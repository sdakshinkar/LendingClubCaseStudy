### Observation: Of the all persons who have taken loan from category C and onwards more than 12% have defaulted, so categories C,D,E,F,G have very high rate of defaults

### Observation: Of the all persons who have taken loan from category B3 and onwards more than 12% have defaulted, so in our earlier observation we had suggested catogory C and onwards as probable defaulters, but as per above analysis subcategories of B ie B3 and onwards are also probable defaulters


### Observation: Of the all persons who have taken loan for term of '60 months' more than 25% have defaulted, so categories term of 60 months have very high rate of defaults

### Observation: Of the all persons who have taken loan from rate of 10% and onwards onwards more than 13% have defaulted, so rate of interest of 10% and higher have very high rate of defaults

 Observation: no significant difference in percentages of defaulted/paid loans as per emp_length
### observation: numberwise when emp length is 10 year more defaults happens

***************** observation: no significant difference in percentages of defaulted/paid loans as per home_ownership
******************* observation: no significant difference in percentages of defaulted/paid loans as per verification_status

observation: numberwise cutomers who own home have lesser defaults on loan
observation: no significant difference in percentages of defaulted/paid loans as per home_ownership

### Observation:

### purpose 'vacation,debt_consolidation,moving,other,educational,house' have medium rates of default
### purpose 'renewable_energy,small_business' have very higher rates of default

************* observation: no significant difference of spread of defaulted/paid loans wrt dti

### observation: slightly more chances of default if the funded amount is greater than 13000
### numberwise applicants funded smaller loan amount defaulted more

********************* ### observation: no significant difference of spread of defaulted/paid loans wrt installment

Bivarate Analysis
----------------



### Observation: apparantly more chances of defaults accross all salary groups if rate of interst is greater than 13.85

### Observation: if the salary range is 140k-160k , and installment is more than 490 then there are more chances of defaulting

### Observation: if the salary range is 80k-100k , and installment is more than 470 then there are apparently more chances of defaulting

### Observation: if the salary range is 60k-80k , and installment is more than 430 then there are apparently more chances of defaulting

### Observations: 
### for salary group of 140k-160k apparently more chances of failure if funded_amnt is greater than 16500
### for salagy group of 120k-140k apparently more chances of failure if funded_amnt is greater than 16275

### Observations: 
### for salary groups of 60k-80k,80k-100k apparently more chances of failure if funded_amnt is greater than 15000

### Observations: 
### for salary groups of 40k-60k apparently more chances of failure if funded_amnt is greater than 12000







Segmented Univariate Analysis

Chances of loan default increses with the below points


2. The loan default rate increases when the applicant does not own the home
3. Applicants having grade B and C having higher loan defaults
4. When the source is verified, it reduces the loan default rate


7. Employees having 10 or more year in the industry defaulted the loan more.
8. Applicants taken smller loan amount defaulted more.


Bivariate Analysis

Observation :

1. Higher the salary the default percentahe is less as we see there are applicants with more loan defaults having salary less than 40K
2. Charged off percent is increasing with interest rate. Interest rate less than 10% or very low has very less chances of charged off. Intrest rates
   interest rate more than 16% or very high has good chnaces of charged off as compared to other category intrest rates.
3. Applicants not owning the home is having high chances of loan defaults.
4. Applicants who is having home loan having lower chances for defaulting loans and applicants having loan for small bussiness having
   higher chances  for defaulting loans.
5. Loan applicants with loan Grade G is having higest Loan Defaults and applicants having Grdae A is lowest Loan Defaulters.
6. People having High Debt to income ration having high risk of loan defaults where as lower debt to income ratio guarantees lower
   chances loan    defaults.
